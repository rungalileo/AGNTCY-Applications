# Building a Weather Vibes Agent using the Agent Context Protocol

Now that you've learned the basics of the Agent Context Protocol, let's build an agent together to help you not only get the weather, but also the vibe of the weather in your area. 

## Overview
Our Weather Vibes agent will:
- Get the current weather for a user-specified location
- Recommend items to bring based on the weather conditions (umbrella, sunglasses, etc.)
- Suggest a YouTube video that matches the weather "vibe"

This will demonstrate several key ACP concepts:
- Agent descriptors and capabilities
- Run management
- Tool integration
- Structured inputs and outputs

Let's build this step by step!

Follow along with this tutorial to build your own Weather Vibes agent.
